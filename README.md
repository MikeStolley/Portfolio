##Description

Project designed around building and then initializing our classes first attempt at a portfolio, to be updated and used for quite some time.

##HTML

the barebones HTML was the first part of the assignment I finished, and is relatively bare bones. Three sections, divided into About me, my work, and how to contact me are set up underneath a hero, and a header with nav links to each section.


##CSS

Initially, this gave me the most trouble. I couldn't figure out an original idea for a site in a week, and every website that I found that I wanted to get a grasp on seemed to utilize bootstrap or similar programs to present much more complex ideas. I ended up trying to style it similarly to the .gif we were given, but I ran out of time.

##Final Product

Despite trying to stay on top of my work, I fell behind due to personal issues. While this is incredibly barren, I don't intend to get this backed up on my work again, and will hopefully updated my portfolio in the next couple weeks, and then run it by a TA not for a grade, but for a personal opinion on an actually completed project. I see the lack of content for this challenge, and I apologize.
